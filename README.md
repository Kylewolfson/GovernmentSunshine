#### _This application allows the user to draw inferences concerning possible connections between lobbyist's and certain legislators_

#### By _Kyle Wolfson, John Klein, Jeffrey Hackford, Justin Fokes, and Jacob Heffley_

## Description

_This application utilizes three main componennts to draw inferences concerning bills and those lobbying for them: 1) cytoscape.js to "draw" connections; 2) several API calls--sometimes nested--which ultimately feed a webcrawler, which requests certain information from our server, newServer.js; and 3) implementation of materialize for styling purposes. This project was compiled using Node.js_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _clone this repository: "https://github.com/Kylewolfson/GroupProjectMergeRepo.git"_
* _npm install, bower install_
* _open a different terminal and run the command "node newServer.js" in the root directory: let the server run in the background of this application_
* _Use gulp build and then gulp serve to open the site in your browser and then just type a name in!_


## Known Bugs

_Bills with more than 10 companies associated with them are having some trouble being displayed._
